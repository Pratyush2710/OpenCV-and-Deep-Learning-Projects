1. Deep Learning Face Detection
    Generally used HaarCascade misses the face at an angle and therefore in this Caffe model of dnn module, we have more accuracy.
    
    Using OpenCV deep neural network module , we require two set of files:
    1. The .prototxt file(s) which define the model architecture (i.e., the layers themselves)
    2. The .caffemodel file which contains the weights for the actual layers
